# SpotipyPractice

This repository holds the files that I used when learning about
the Spotify API. I used Spotipy, a lightweight Python
library for the Spotify Web API. I familiarized myself with
the different endpoints and practiced requesting certain data 
of artists and songs. My end goal is to use the pandas
library to consolidate data about songs in my own playlists
and use this to generate high-quality song recommendations.
